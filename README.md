# agent-tripwire

A runtime detection daemon for developer workstations. Watches your sensitive paths (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, agent configs, browser cookies, etc.), walks the process tree to figure out who touched them, and tells you in past tense. Local-first. No cloud. Detection only — not a blocker. Designed to run **alongside** install-time blockers like Aikido Safe Chain.

## Status

**Phase 0 + Phase 1 steps 1–3 complete.** Monorepo scaffold, `@tripwire/shared`, `@tripwire/store` (SQLite + 4 tables), and `@tripwire/feeds` (Aikido fetcher + `FeedSource` interface + merger + orchestrator) have landed. Smoke-tested against the live Aikido endpoint: 129K IoCs parsed cleanly. Next: AWS Lambda deployment to publish a merged snapshot to S3 on a daily schedule, then `@tripwire/watcher` (fanotify/fsevents) per [`spec/agent-tripwire-spec.md §12`](./spec/agent-tripwire-spec.md).
