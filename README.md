# agent-tripwire

A runtime detection daemon for developer workstations. Watches your sensitive paths (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, agent configs, browser cookies, etc.), walks the process tree to figure out who touched them, and tells you in past tense. Local-first. No cloud. Detection only — not a blocker. Designed to run **alongside** install-time blockers like Aikido Safe Chain.

## Status

**Phase 1, step 1 in progress.** Monorepo scaffold, `@tripwire/shared` (types, severity helpers, ancestry-category precedence, logger), and JSON schemas for events and rules have landed. Next: `@tripwire/store` (SQLite + migrations) per [`spec/agent-tripwire-spec.md §12`](./spec/agent-tripwire-spec.md).
